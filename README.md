Algorithms Homework 5

Description:

Little Bill loves to draw figures in his new "Connect The Dots" book. However, he wishes to know how to connect dots so that he uses the minimum amount of ink.

The points lie on a plane at (x,y) positions. You will use Prim's algorithm to help out Bill.

Input:

The input begins with a single integer indicating the number of cases that follow. That integer is followed by a blank line and a blank line also separates different test cases.

The first line of each cases will be the number of total dots, 0 < n <= 100. This is followed by n number of (x,y) points for each dot.

Output:

The output of consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.

You should output one real number rounded to two decimal places. This number will be the minimum total amount of ink to connect all dots.

Sample Input:
1

3
1.0 1.0
2.0 2.0
2.0 4.0

Sample Output:
3.41
